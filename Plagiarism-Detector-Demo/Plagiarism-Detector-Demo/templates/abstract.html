    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>Plagiarism is the act of using or presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as your own without giving proper credit or acknowledgment to the source. It is considered a serious academic and ethical offense in most settings, including academia, journalism, and creative industries. The procedure of human-based plagiarism detection is time-consuming, inaccurate, and difficult. In this paper, a plagiarism detection based on two deep learning models: A combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer-based model is proposed. In terms of outcomes, research has demonstrated that deep learning models can identify plagiarism with high accuracy. One study, for instance, employed a combination of the CNN-LSTM model to detect plagiarism and had a 99.51% success rate. Another study, for instance, employed a transformer-based model to detect plagiarism and had a high accuracy rate such as 99.61%.</p>
